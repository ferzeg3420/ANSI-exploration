# POSIX shell ansi exploration

This program, which I aptly named ansi, showcases changing colors,
ringing the bell, hiding the user's input, blinking text, and
removing the effects of these escape characters.

Amazing, world-changing and other superlatives. I know.  You can
use this program to test how your 16 basic colors will look on your
terminal, and also as a reference/cheatsheet.
